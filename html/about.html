        <p  class="aboutme">Deborah Buzuayehu is a New York based graphic designer. Buzuayehu started as a fine 
                artist, but developed an interest for graphic 
                design at an early age. She later enrolled in the 
                pristegious design university Parsons School 
                of Design for her undergraduate studies. 
                Today Buzuayehu is a full time student who 
                has managed to already gain small press from 
                large design houses like Marc Jacobs.
                Her experience and study in design 
                and business management provide solid 
                support in the communication design 
                department. Buzuayehus’ record of being 
                rehired as an intern attest to her hard work 
                and enthusiasm towards the future. 
                She has found that her primary interest is 
                in the advertising and brand design field.In 
                the future, Buzuayehu hopes to use her 
                design to create change and have a voice 
                towards modern day issues. 
                She is determined to use her skills as a 
                means to reveal new perspectives, thereby 
                improving the way we live our lives. </p>
